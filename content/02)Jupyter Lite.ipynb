    "This notebook is about JupyterLite\n",
    "\n",
    "* JupyterLite is about accessible browser orientated collaborative computting. It is a fully static distribution which runs browser side, without having to run jupyter notebook/lab in a terminal on a user's local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The static files JupyterLite uses means there is no need to excecute a backend enviroment making it easily scalable and easier to deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A user can interact with there own jupyterlite instance in the browser with the same functionality as the local instance, however a drawback is when a notebook is launched in the browser any work done won't be saved for that a user much use the local instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* JupyterLite makes it easier to run multiple kernals in the browser at the same time such as a JavaScript kernal, the theme of the notebook can be changed, widgets and other such imports can be handled in the requirements.txt in the local instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* JupyterLite is lightweight saving space on your PC to run python in the browser with jupyterlite alongside GitHub pages, in the demo section one such demo is setting up a jupyterlite instance on GitHub pages.\n",
